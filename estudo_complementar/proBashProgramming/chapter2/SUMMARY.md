* **standard I/O streams**: There are streams of bytes from which commands reads and to which output is sent.

* **Arguments**: These are words that fllow a command; arguments may include options as well as other information such as filenames.

* **Parameters**: These are entities that store values; the three types are: 
    * positional Parameters
    * special Parameters
    * variables
    
* **Pipelines**: A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by ( **|** ); the standard output of the command preceding the pipe symbol is fed to the standard input of the command following it.

* **Command Substitution**: This means storing the output of a command in a variable or on the command line.
