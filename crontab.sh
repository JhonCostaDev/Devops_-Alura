# Crontab (short for cron table) is a utility in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS) 
# used to schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at specified intervals. The scheduled 
# tasks are called cron jobs and are managed by the cron daemon (crond).

# It's an essential tool for task automation, commonly used for things like running backups, 
# cleaning up logs, or performing system maintenance at off-peak hours.
